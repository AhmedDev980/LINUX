 User Applications (Vim, Docker, Apache, etc.)     |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.)                     |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Libraries (glibc, libc, OpenSSL, etc.)     |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Utilities (ls, grep, systemctl, etc.)      |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Linux Kernel (Process, Memory, FS, Network)       |  <-- Core of the OS

Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)

ðŸ”¹ A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
ðŸ”¹ Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
ðŸ”¹ Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.
